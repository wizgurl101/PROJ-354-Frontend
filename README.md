## Description

This repo host the frontend files I was responsible for implementing for my Group's Capstone Project.

## About the project

Bridgeland Bakery is an online only bread subscription business and they were interested in a proof-of-concept to be
made for a customer management system. The system was to help the client manage their commerical and subscription customers.

For the frontend, my process involved first making the HTML template of the layout with Bootstrap 4.  This allow me to troubleshoot layout issues and helped me to learn the framework in a timely matter.  Once the layout was done, I would make a JavaServer Page (JSP) of the screen and implemented the code to communicate with the backend.

The following technologies was used to implement this system: JavaServer Pages, Bootstrap 4, HTML5/CSS3, Java Servlet and MySQL.

## What have I learnt from this project

- I had to learn Bootstrap 4 framework so that time spend on implementing the UI would be less and completed according to our timeline.
- As a result, I improve and practice my time management skill to account for time spend on tutorial while
  meeting the project's milestones
- How to troubleshoot issues with version control on remote repository such as GitHub
- Proper communication skills was essential to work collaborative on a remote project. For my part, I made word documents to the teammates working on backend. These documents hightlighted what methods are required, data format, query parameter names, to name a few.
- Learnt how to deal and manage requirement changes.
- The important of confirming and setting up the right development enivornment with all members on the team.
